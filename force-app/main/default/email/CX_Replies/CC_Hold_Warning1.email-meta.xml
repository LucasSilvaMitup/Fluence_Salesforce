We recently sent you a replacement for the faulty XxxFaulty Item NamexxX  from your Fluence Order # XxxOrder #xxX. I hope you are pleased with your replacement!

I just wanted to send you a friendly reminder that you will need to send the faulty part back to our facility within 25 days of the credit hold date in order to avoid being charged for the replacement. If you have not shipped the item by XXxCharge DatexxX, your card will be charged Xxx AmountxxX.

If you have already sent back the materials, or if the package is currently in transit, please reply to this message with the package’s tracking information to avoid being charged. Otherwise, please pack up the item(s) and ship it back to the address below. Please ensure the following:
