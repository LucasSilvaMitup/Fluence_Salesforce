    <textOnly>Hello {!Case.Contact},

Thanks for your time today!

Per our conversation, I have created replacement orders in our system for your Xxx_faulty item_xxX. These have been authorized as RMA# {!Case.QN__c} - please hold on to this number for your records. Your replacement will be leaving our facility within the next 2 business days.

Additionally, I have initiated a hold on your credit card for the value of your replacement item. This hold will appear on your statement as a pending transaction of Xxx_$value_xxX from Fluence Bioengineering.

Please pack up the item in the packaging your replacement will arrive in and ship it to the address below. Please ensure the following:

•	Remove all mounting hardware and accessories before packing. Technicians will not be responsible for any lost accessories or mounting hardware sent with your fixture and/or power supply.
•	Shipping insurance is highly recommended on return packages of values greater than $100


Ship To:

Fluence Bioengineering{!Case.QN__c}4129 Commercial Center DriveDock #13Austin, Texas 78744

Be sure to send the faulty part back AND REPLY WITH TRACKING INFO by [CC Charge Date] to avoid a charge to your card.
