    <textOnly>Hello {!Case.Contact},

Thank you for your email. I have reviewed your order history, and unfortunately the order tied to your faulty light, dated Xxx_Order Date_xxX, has surpassed our Xxx_3 year/5 year_xxX warranty period. Additionally, as we have a very limited supply of our legacy stock on hand, we are no longer able to offer any of these parts for sale. The best recommendation I can make at this time is to contact an electronic repair shop in your area for a consultation.

Sorry I couldnâ€™t be of any further assistance. Let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns!</textOnly>
