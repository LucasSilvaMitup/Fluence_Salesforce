    <textOnly>Hello {!Case.Contact},

Thanks for your time on the phone today. Per our conversation, as part of Fluence&apos;s proactive replacement program I will be arranging for a new power supply to be shipped out to you within the next 2 business days. We will send you an email notification once it has left our warehouse.

Please also find attached a prepaid return label you can use to send back your current power supply. Feel free to wait until the replacement arrives so you can make use of its packaging.

Thanks again for supporting Fluence. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns!</textOnly>
