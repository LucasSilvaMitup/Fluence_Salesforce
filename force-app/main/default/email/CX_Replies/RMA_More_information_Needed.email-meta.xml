    <textOnly>Hello {!Case.Contact},

Thank you for contacting us. My name is Xxx_Name_xxX, with the Fluence Customer Experience team. I&apos;m sorry to hear you are experiencing issues with your light! In order to best assist you with your warranty claim, please provide me with a brief description of the issue and as much of the following information as possible.

•	Name

If you are having difficulty locating the serial number on your fixture, it can be located on either the power supply or the fixture itself.
