    <textOnly>Hello {!Case.Contact},

It was a pleasure speaking with you today! Please find attached a prepaid FedEx return shipping label for your Xx_Faulty item_xxX. Per our conversation, I have created orders to have a replacement sent to your Xxx_address_xxX. . These orders have been authorized as RMA # {!Case.QN__c} - please keep this for your records. Your replacement item will ship from our facility within the next 2 business days.

Feel free to use the packaging your replacement will arrive in to ship us the faulty item; please make sure the return label completely covers the existing one.

My apologies again for the trouble. If I can be of any further assistance, please let me know!</textOnly>
