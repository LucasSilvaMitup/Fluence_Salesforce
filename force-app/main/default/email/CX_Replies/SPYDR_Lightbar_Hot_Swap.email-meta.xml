    <textOnly>Hello {!Case.Contact},

Sorry to hear you&apos;re experiencing issues with one of your lights!

Before we proceed with initiating a warranty claim, I would like to do a little troubleshooting with you to determine exactly what is causing the issue. If you have not already done so, can please try swapping the faulty light bar to a different power lead on your fixture&apos;s central console and let me know if the issue persists?

I look forward to hearing back from you!</textOnly>
