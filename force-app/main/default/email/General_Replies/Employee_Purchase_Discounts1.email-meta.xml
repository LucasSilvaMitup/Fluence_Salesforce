    <textOnly>Hello {!Case.Contact},

We can certainly get this going for you. The discount is 40% off MSRP. The easiest way to build the product that you would like will be to build the SKU in the webstore. I’ve linked you to Web store page.  Other than that, it’s really just picking out the accessories such as quantity, power cord length, and plug type.

The SKU will get built at the bottom of the page when you make these selections. Can you copy that SKU back here and also confirm the shipping address?  We’ll enter an order and send you a link to make payment.

Thanks!</textOnly>
